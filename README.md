## Issues during task and my prompt to AI to fix my issue

- So, i took help from AI to ask what to keep in my .vimrc file my prompt was  `Hey bro, i am confused based on steps of our assignment may you please help me to create content that i can put inside my .vimrc file` It sort of gave me script to put inside .vimrc file then i copied and tried to understand the stuff vimrc file and decided to keep jelly-bean in it.
- Also the next help i took was for the install.sh script my prompt was `Is the stuff inside my install.sh correct` and it was indeed incorrect and gave me fixed code where it was kind of copying my vimrc file which was in my home directory to the repo as well i realized i need in that lab
- There was lots of headache during this lab as while i was configuring Vim with Vundle and the jellybeans colorscheme, the following error appeared: `E185: Cannot find color scheme 'jellybeans'` then to fix the issues i done following steps as far as i remember:
- Firstly i checked if vundle.vim existed then i sort of recloned the entire vundle pacakageand then reinstall the pacakage and sort of again run thescript and kept try and catch in my .vimrc file as a result it worked in my machine
- I created the test file which was test.py to check if there is jellybean theme
- I also sort of took help from ai as it remmonded me to plug try and catch to figure out jellybean them problem ans my prompt was like `May you please modify my .vimrc and explain what is wrong there`
